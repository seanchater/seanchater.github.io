# Some Adventures

I went up to an area of the Northern Cederberg called Rocklands over the long easter weekend to attend a gathering of highliners. Highlining is the practice of stringing a piece of webbing that is 25mm wide between two cliffs and attempting to walk across it (while tied in with a harness of course).

The reason I went up for the gathering was because I wanted to help rig the highlines as I thoroughly enjoy the process of working out how to efficiently put in place a system that you, and other people, will trust there life on. A friend and I have been learning about the art of rigging for the past year but this was an amazing spot to put this into practice with other experienced highliners around to ask questions and learn from.

It was also an amazing apportunity to conquer some fears and practice new skills.

I would love to be able to integrate the GIS knowledge I have with this hobby and have had an idea in the works of creating a database with a web based map which contains vector layers that indicate the different highline rigging spots around South Africa, with attribute information such as how long the line is, quality of the rock for bolts to be put in, permits needed to access the area, etc...

Hopefully I get the time to implement that this year as I feel it would be a great opportunity for me to put multiple skills to the test as well as creating something useful for a community I am part of.
