# Software Development Management

I have been exposed to version control systems (VCS) since 2019 and have been using them for university projects ranging from [small webscrapers](https://github.com/seanchater/webscraper) to games such as chess (Figure 1) and an othello bot, [client-server chat programs](https://github.com/seanchater/client-server_chat) and [VOIP applications](https://github.com/seanchater/voip_chat), [data cleaning](#data-cleaning-code-for-enron-dataset) and visualisation of the [Enron dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset) and a spatio-temporal social network website that allowed users to connect and find events close to them based on a map view (unfortunately this cannot be linked to as we removed it from the hosting service soon after the project ended due to hosting fees, but the video run through can be found on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQouRawVAXWux-RRiOixJeA)).

I used GitLab for the above mentioned projects, which means I also got a taste of CI/CD pipelines, as well as build automation tools such as Maven which was used on a small program for a honours topic assignment algorithm.

Once the learning curve has been dealt with, VCS's are actually quite intuitive to work with and definitely help with data management. Our team considered using a GitHub repo for our [Geodatabase project](../pages/geodb.md) but decided to back our database up to google drive for simplicity, and becuase we were using ArcPro to work with the database it was not possible to merge files if we had worked on the database concurrently, which means using Git would have just added extra steps to the process.
