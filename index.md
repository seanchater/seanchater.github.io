## Project management

Having been part of a team that worked with the Stellenbosch University Botanical
Gardens, I have improved my skills in managing a team as well as planning ahead
and overcoming unforseen obstacles. Some examples of this are ...

To keep on track with this project our team proposed a Gantt chart at the beginning
of the project which outlined the flow of processes we were expecting to follow, who was responsible for
those processes and a rough timeline of when they were expected to be finished. This Gantt chart was
continuously updated throughout the project so we were sure to keep delivering on a consistent schedule, one of our iterations can be seen below to give an understanding of how it looks while a project is in progress.
