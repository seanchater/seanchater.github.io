## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/seanchater/seanchater.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Project management

Having been part of a team that worked with the Stellenbosch University Botanical
Gardens, I have improved my skills in managing a team as well as planning ahead
and overcoming unforseen obstacles. Some examples of this are ...

To keep on track with this project our team proposed a Gantt chart at the beginning
of the project which outlined the flow of processes we were expecting to follow, who was responsible for
those processes and a rough timeline of when they were expected to be finished. This Gantt chart was
continuously updated throughout the project so we were sure to keep delivering on a consistent schedule, one of our iterations can be seen below to give an understanding of how it looks while a project is in progress.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/seanchater/seanchater.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
